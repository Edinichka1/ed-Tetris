## Features
It's Tetris.

Use the left/right arrow keys to adjust the horizontal position of a falling piece.
Use the 'x'/'c' to rotate a falling piece.
Use the 'z' to rotate on 180 falling piece.
Use the 'down' arrow key to increase the falling-speed of a piece.
Use the 'spacebar' to drop the piece quickly.

There is a mechanic for a short delay before falling in order to put the figure under another one.
